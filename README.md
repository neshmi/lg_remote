# LG IP Remote

This [Go](http://golang.org) based remote is a simple IP based remote for controlling multiple LG Smart TVs, written to ease work with CAVE environments (see [CalVR](https://github.com/calvr)).

I wrote this in Go as an exercise to teach myself Go, so it is probably poorly written and could use some serious revisions.
